title: Macrobase - Prioritizing Attention in Fast Data
author: Peter Bailis
---

MacroBase is a new kind of data analysis engine designed to prioritize human attention in large-scale fast data streams. Given
increasing data volumes that are increasingly too large for manual inspection, MacroBase highlights interesting behaviors in
streams and produces explanations for these behaviors that can be used for tasks including diagnostics, alerting, and root cause
analysis. 

<blockquote>
MacroBase has already found interesting, previously unknown behaviors and trends in production data in domains
including mobile telematics, datacenter operations, electrical utilities, and satellite imaging. The purpose of this document is to
describe the architecture, interaction model, and ongoing research in the MacroBase project.
